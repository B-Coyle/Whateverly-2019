<h3>Team strengths: </h3>
Bridgett-Organization, not attached to code 
Emily- Diligent, hard-working persistent, willing to try something new, not attached to code

<h3>How to overcome obstacles: </h3>

-Take POM breaks 
-Set struggle timers (don’t set them for too long) (30-40 minutes) 


<h3>Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?): </h3>
Daily pulse checks
Emily- no life. Prefer to work here or at coffee shops. 
Bridgett- no life. Prefer to work here or at coffee shops.

Work together as much as possible


<h3>Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): </h3>
Bridgett- Require some time to learn concepts . All have to touch the code to learn. Came in with 0 knowledge
Emily- Same.  All have to touch code to learn. Came in with 0 knowledge
Katie- Talk through it and make sure is using technical words. Have to touch code to learn. Also came in with 0 knowledge


<h3>Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):  </h3>
Take turns with the code. Work together for code. Driver/Navigator hybrid. Include a JSFun/Codewar to warm up or break for codewar. 

<h3>Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests): </h3>
Switch off every hour or so so everyone can get hands on the code. If together we can merge through the code. If separate we setup a PR. Add in the comments sections for PR what we intend on doing next.

-Don’t be a jerk
